Initiates an asynchronous read operation on the pipe.

```csharp
public IAsyncResult BeginRead(Byte[] buffer, int offset, int length, AsyncCallback userCallback, object stateObject)
```

#### Parameters

`buffer` [Byte[]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.byte)<br>
Buffer that will receive the data read from the pipe.

`offset` [Int32](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.int32)<br>
Byte offset within the buffer at which to begin writing the data received.

`length` [Int32](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.int32)<br>
Length of the data to transfer.

`userCallback` [AsyncCallback](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.asynccallback)<br>

                An optional asynchronous callback, to be called when the operation is complete. Can be null
                if no callback is required.

`stateObject` [Object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object)<br>

                A user-provided object that distinguishes this particular asynchronous operation. Can be null
                if not required.

#### Returns

[IAsyncResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iasyncresult)<br>
An  object representing the asynchronous operation, which could still be pending.

**Remarks:**

This method always completes immediately even if the operation is still pending. The [IAsyncResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iasyncresult)
 object returned represents the operation
 and must be passed to [USBPipe.EndRead(IAsyncResult)](./nefarius.drivers.winusb.usbpipe.md#endreadiasyncresult) to retrieve the result of the operation. For every call to this method
 a matching call to
 [USBPipe.EndRead(IAsyncResult)](./nefarius.drivers.winusb.usbpipe.md#endreadiasyncresult) must be made. When  specifies a callback function, this
 function will be called when the operation is completed. The optional
  parameter can be used to pass user-defined information to this callback or the
 [IAsyncResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iasyncresult). The [IAsyncResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iasyncresult)
 also provides an event handle ([IAsyncResult.AsyncWaitHandle](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iasyncresult.asyncwaithandle)) that will be triggered when the
 operation is complete as well.

### **EndRead(IAsyncResult)**

Waits for a pending asynchronous read operation to complete.

```csharp
public int EndRead(IAsyncResult asyncResult)
```

#### Parameters

`asyncResult` [IAsyncResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iasyncresult)<br>

                The  object representing the asynchronous operation,
                as returned by .

#### Returns

[Int32](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.int32)<br>
The number of bytes transferred during the operation.

**Remarks:**

Every call to [USBPipe.BeginRead(Byte[], Int32, Int32, AsyncCallback, Object)](./nefarius.drivers.winusb.usbpipe.md#beginreadbyte-int32-int32-asynccallback-object) must have a matching call to [USBPipe.EndRead(IAsyncResult)](./nefarius.drivers.winusb.usbpipe.md#endreadiasyncresult) to dispose
 of any resources used and to retrieve the result of the operation. When the operation was successful the method
 returns the number
 of bytes that were transferred. If an error occurred during the operation this method will throw the exceptions
 that would
 otherwise have occurred during the operation. If the operation is not yet finished EndWrite will wait for the
 operation to finish before returning.

 returns the number
 of bytes that were transferred. If an error occurred during the operation this method will throw the exceptions
 that would
 otherwise have occurred during the operation. If the operation is not yet finished EndWrite will wait for the
 operation to finish before returning.
